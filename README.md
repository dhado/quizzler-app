# quizzler-app
This project is called `Quizzler App`.

## Overview
This code imports the Question, question_data, QuizBrain, and QuizInterface classes from their respective files. It then creates a list called question_bank and iterates through the question_data list to create new Question objects with the question text and correct answer. It then creates a QuizBrain object with the question_bank list as an argument and a QuizInterface object with the quiz object as an argument. Finally, it prints out a message that the quiz has been completed and displays the user's final score.
